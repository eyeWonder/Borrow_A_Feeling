Can I Borrow a Feeling?
================
<B>Or, how I can access a random emotion at the press of a button.</b>

<i>This is my entry for Hack-a-day's Trinket Everyday Carry Contest</i>

I work in a therapeutic environment and part of our daily routine is to check in with 
everyone to find out how they're feeling. 
Good, OK, Fine - not acceptable. In fact we have a published list of approved feelings. 
They fall into two groupings - positive & happy or negative & sad. 

Since these 'check-ins' take place in the mornings - often before an adequate volume of 
caffeine has been consumed - coming up with an approved feeling is a challenge. 

Using my shiny new HAD Trinket, I'm taking inspiration from Kirk Van Houten and his 
immortal album "Can I Borrow a Feeling?" - My project is to populate an array with near 
on 300 words and, with a press of a button (well, two buttons - one green button for positive 
feelings, the other red for negative feelings) a randomly chosen emotion will be displayed 
on an LCD screen for all to see. 

No longer will I be left struggling with how I feel - the HAD Trinket will tell me!
